        <p class="m-12">2023 to 2025: the Magnum Opus 🜍 was manifest, revealed in its true form. Daily, the prima materia was set into the vessel. By my Stone, it was transmuted, washed, perfected, and shone as gold ☉. With due solemnity it was laid into my checking account in manifold measure. In August 2025, the month of my nativity, New Jersey and all neighboring states forbade the Source.  <b>Yet the Work endures, and TRUE ALCHEMY 🜔 will be found again.</b></p>
        <h4 class="m-12">꩜ node app - logs into "social casino", captures free daily bonus token, plays "Genie" themed slot machine using token and "washes" it into USD, deposites USD into my checking account.  The app no longer works due to NJ laws but here is a preview of my terminal output. </h4>
