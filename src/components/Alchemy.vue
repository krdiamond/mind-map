        <p class="m-12">From the years 2023 to 2025 the Magnum Opus 🜍 was made manifest, revealed in its true form.  Daily the prima materia, freely bestowed, was set into the vessel. By my Stone it was transmuted, washed and perfected, until it shone as gold ☉ and with due solemnity deposited into my checking account in manifold measure. In August 2025, the month of my nativity, New Jersey's rulers forbade the Source, now barred in NJ, NY, and neighboring states. Yet the Work is eternal — TRUE ALCHEMY 🜔 will be discovered again.</p>
        <h4 class="m-12">꩜ node app - logs into "social casino", captures daily bonus token, plays "Genie" themed slot machine using token and "washes" it into real dollars, depositis dollars into my checking account.  The app no longer works due to NJ laws but here is a preview of my terminal output. </h4>
