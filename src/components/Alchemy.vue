        <h2>Alchemy</h2>
      <p>
        From 2023 - August 2025 I ran an app on a spare computer that essentially exploited a "social casino".  "Social Casinos" offer USD payouts when users purchase their "social" coins to play slot machines. It is an online gambling loophole. Some casinos offer 1 free coin per a day for simply logging in.  I was running about 4 casinos but only 1 was reliable.  My app would automanically log in every morning, collect the 1 coin and then "wash" it by playing a slot machine. The payouts were coins that were redemable for USD.  I never played the slot machines myself or put any of my own money in.  I made a lot of money doing this.  This was a source of true ‚óé Alchemy ‚óé ! </p>
        <p>Then in Aug 2025, NJ freaking passed a new law banning all "simulated gambling" and "social casinos" are now blocked in NJ, NY and all surrounding states so this project is dead.</p> 
        <p>I won't even get into how complicated it was to make an app that could actually play their slot machines and respond to all the different reactions the machines had.  I had to make sure it responded to everything so that the app wouldn't get stuck.  Also, I had to make sure I could collect my jackpots (there were many) without skipping over them.  It was a tiresome process and my friends and family thought it wasn't worth the money (or they thought I was crazy and didn't want to hear about it) but I live for this shit so <span class="">ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span>.
